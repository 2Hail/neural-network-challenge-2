# neural-network-challenge-2

In this challenge, we focused on using Neural Networks to create a model with layers to test and look for the information such as accuracy and loss for our 'department' and 'attrition' variables.

We utilized activations such as relu and softmax. Along with this also using Binary Crossentropy and Categorical Crossentropy in building our model.
